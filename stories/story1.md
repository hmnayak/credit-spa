# Grocery Distribution

Convenience stores in villages, towns, and cities serve the purpose of providing everyday items to people in the neighbourhood. Such stores themselves receive their supplies from wholesale sellers. A common setup is that of a wholesale seller (referred to as distributor for brevity hereafter) in a town or a city supplying good to villages nearby, spread over a 30-50km radius.

The lifecycle of operations from the perspective of distributor typically has the following order.

    Customer visits distributor, and puts forth an intention to receive supplies.

    Distributor puts forth terms such as timeframe for making payments.

    Customer starts placing orders for goods at the distributor.

    Distributor dispatches orders to customers.

    After every delivery customer makes payments towards the penultimate order.

Distributors typically receive payments with a lag of one order. It implies that there is always so called outstanding amount that customers owe to distributors. Such an arrangement provides corner stores time to sell goods to consumers, recover their investment on the goods, and then pay back to distributors.

It is common for customers to pay by cash. Cheques and demand drafts are also used as a payment instrument. A rarer form of payment is in terms of goods. Goods such as defective items are occasionally returned by customers. There is also the case corner stores selling back to distributors certain supplies that sections of society receive as ration from the government.

Besides convenience stores, customers of distributors include suppliers of ready-made food, savoury snack makers, hotels, caterers etc.

One form of organising delivery of supplies to customers is along distribution routes. For example, route A can be a round-trip from distributor to a bunch of customers on the way to a neighbouring town, and back. Goods vehicles make trips on various routes on regular basis providing supplies to customers. As mentioned before, customers receive goods, and make payments towards outstanding amount.
